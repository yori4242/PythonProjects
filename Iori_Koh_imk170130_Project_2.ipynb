    "# Project 2 Starter\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Project 2 is to facilitate students practice of the following Data Science concepts:\n",
    "- Train and tune classification model\n",
    "- Perform feature engineering to improve model performance\n",
    "- Explain/interpret and debug model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will include following tasks:\n",
    "- Load dataset. Don't use \"index\" column for training.\n",
    "- Clean up the data:\n",
    "    - Encode replace missing values\n",
    "    - Replace features values that appear incorrect\n",
    "    - Encode numerical variables that come as strings, for example string `$100.01` should be converted to numerical value\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables\n",
    "- Split dataset to Train/Test/Validation. If you perform cross-validation while tuning hyper-parameters, you don't need validation dataset.\n",
    "- Add engineered features. Simple encoding (Target encoding) for individual feature doesn't count to the 10 required engineered features\n",
    "- Train and tune ML models\n",
    "- Provide final metrics using Test (hold-out) dataset:\n",
    "    - Classification: AUC\n",
    "    - Confusion matrix for best F1\n",
    "- Interpret final trained model using Test dataset:\n",
    "    - Global feature importance using both Shapley values and permutation feature importance\n",
    "    - Summary plot with Shapley values \n",
    "    - Individual observations analysis using Shapley values. Two records for each of the scenarios with significant probability:\n",
    "        - Label `0` is correctly identified\n",
    "        - Label `0` is identified as `1`\n",
    "        - Label `1` is correctly identified\n",
    "        - Label `1` is identified as `0`\n",
    "        - Significant probability means high probability of being correct/in-correct (depending on the scenario)"

Small businesses have been a primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment. There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such as FedEx and Apple Computer. However, there have also been stories of small businesses and/or start-ups that have defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans.  \n",
